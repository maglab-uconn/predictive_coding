About the files in this folder

predictive_coding_figures.R is the R script used to generate the figures in our manuscript ("Does predictive processing imply predictive coding in models of spoken word recognition?").

This script reads in several data files, described briefly below:
GHD_DP_revised.csv - data for the Gagnepain, Henson, & Davis simulations
PC_SRN_Test_Activation_Flow_Fixed.csv - data from our SRN simulations
ppc_phone_out.txt - TRACE data (phoneme activation)
ppc_comb_out.txt - TRACE data (other metrics)
