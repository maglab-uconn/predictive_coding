About the files in this folder

pppc_figures.R is the R script used to generate the figures in our manuscript ("Does signal reduction imply predictive coding in models of spoken word recognition?").

This script reads in several data files, described briefly below:

(1) GHD_DP_revised.csv - data for the Gagnepain, Henson, & Davis simulations

(2) SRN_Result_Data.Use_Frequency.csv - data from our SRN simulations
(3) gagnepain_items_revised.csv - additional details for items (e.g., deviation point)

(4) trace_ghd_comb_out.txt - TRACE data (combined metrics)
(5) trace_ghd_lex_out.txt - TRACE data (lexical layer activation)
(6) trace_ghd_phone_out.txt - TRACE data (phoneme layer activation)

This script generates several figures, named fig*.png, where the * is replaced by the figure number from the manuscript.
